## Purpose of the Analysis:
Bike sharing systems are getting popular and becoming a new generation of traditional bike rentals where the whole process from membership, rental and return has become automatic – easier than before. Through these systems, a user can easily rent a bike from a position and return the bike at another position without stress or paperwork. Currently, there are about over 500 bike-sharing programs around the world which is composed of over 500 thousand bicycles. There are recent research interests in these systems due to their important role in traffic, environmental and health issues. 
Apart from interesting real-world applications of bike sharing systems, the features of data being generated by these systems make them attractive for the research. Opposed to other transport services such as bus or subway, the duration of travel, departure and arrival position are explicitly recorded in these systems. These features turn bike sharing systems into a virtual sensor network that can be used for sensing mobility in a city or location. Hence, it is expected that most of the important events in a city or location could be detected via monitoring these data.
Here, it is of interest to calculate the likelihood of rightly claiming that holiday does not influence the average number of bikes rented daily. And how big our sample size can be for increasing this likelihood.

## Description of the Pilot Data:
The dataset “Bike-Sharing-Dataset” was collected by the Laboratory of Artificial Intelligence and Decision Support (LIAAD), University of Porto which contains the daily count of rental bikes for the years 2011 and 2012 from Capital Bikeshare system, Washington D.C., USA (http://capitalbikeshare.com/system-data). The aggregated data with the corresponding holiday, weather and seasonal information was also collected by the Laboratory of Artificial Intelligence and Decision Support (LIAAD), University of Porto. The dataset was downloaded from UCI Machine Learning Repository https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bike+Sharing+Dataset. Weather information were extracted from http://www.freemeteo.com.
Our response variable is count ("cnt") with predictors – weather situation ("WEATHERstat"), holiday ("holiday"), feeling temperature ("TEMPfel"), humidity ("Humid"), and windspeed ("WINDSPEED"). For full description of the variables on interest, see Appendix.


## Proposed Analysis:
The negative binomial regression model:
$$
\ln(\mu_i)= \beta_0+\beta_1(weathersit)+\beta_2(holiday)+\beta_3(TEMPfel)+\beta_4(Humid)+\beta_5(WINDSPEED)
$$
would be used because our response variable is a count data. Also, negative binomial is the most appropriate because it accommodates the extra variation parameter that exceeds that allowed by the Poisson count regression model. It is of interest to get a reasonably high power estimate that indicates a high likelihood of rightly rejecting the null (that is, holiday does not influence the average number of bikes rented daily) when it is false. Also, it is of interest to know how big the sample size should be for increasing power estimates. For the purpose of this study, the $\beta$ estimates would be used for the simulation, like a result from a pilot data. Then the predictors and response will be simulated using an appropriate distribution that mimicks their behaviour.

Weather situation, holiday will be simulated by assigning random numbers with appropriate probabilities for the levels. While the mean and variance relationship might not accounted for using this method compared to the multinomial distribution, the random sampling will still produce an estimate for the power for this particular study. Feeling temperature will be simulated using the normal distribution; while humidity and windspeed will be simulated using the skew-normal distribution due to the nature of the variables. By setting seed, it guarantees the reproducibility of the result and also to maintain the nature of the simulated variables. Observe that humidity is bounded by $0$ and $100$, and windspeed cannot take negative values. The skew-normal distribution produced a similar result with no negative values for both variables. The left-skewness of the variables invoked the use of this distribution. Note that there is possibility for outliers in this simulation, but the behaviour of the power values for different sample size should give an insight as to how well the simulation worked. The response variable - count was simulated using the negative binomial distribution. 

The sample size is 731 with 1000 replicates for the simulation. The p-value for the variable holiday is of interest which will be recorded and compared to $5\%$ significance level. The proportion of datasets that showed significance is the empirical power. 

## Analysis Results:
From the simulation output below, the estimate of power, $\hat{p}=0.985.$
```{r powe, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(sn);library(MASS)
MLRP <- function(N=731,M=1000){
# REGRESSION COEFFICIENTS #
beta0 = 8.149
TFbeta1 = 0.039
Webeta2 = -0.137
Hbeta3 = -0.199
WSbeta4 = -0.0153
Hubeta5 = -0.00515

  results1 <- rep(0,M)
  p1 <- rep(0,M)
  set.seed(123)
  
  for(i in 1:M)
  {
    # GENERATE DATA FOR PREDICTORS #
    TF<-rnorm(n=N,23.718,8.148)
    WeaS<-sample(1:3, N, replace=TRUE, prob=c(0.6,0.3,0.1))
    Hol<-sample(0:1, N, replace=TRUE, prob= c(0.9,0.1))
    WS <- rsn(n=N, 12.763, 12.125, 5.192357)
    Hum <- rsn(n=N, xi=62.67, omega=14.24291, alpha = 0, tau=62.79)
    
    
    # GENERATE DATA FOR REPONSE #
    CT <- rnbinom(n=N, mu = exp(beta0+TFbeta1*TF+Webeta2*WeaS+Hbeta3*Hol+WSbeta4*WS+Hubeta5*Hum), size = 6.868)
    
    NBR <- glm.nb(CT~TF+WeaS+Hol+WS+Hum)
 
    p1[i] = anova(NBR)[,"Pr(>Chi)"][4]
    
    if(p1[i] < 0.05){results1[i]=1}
  }
  
 list(Power1 =mean(results1))
}
MLRP()$Power1

## CALCULATE FOR SAMPLE SIZES OF 100,250,500,750,1000 ##
ss_values=c(100,250,500,750,1000)
power_values = rep(0,5)

for(i in 1:length(ss_values))
{
  power_values[i] = MLRP(N=ss_values[i])$Power1
}
power_values
```
 
The power estimates for sample sizes 100, 250, 500, 750, and 1000 are $0.355, 0.681, 0.927, 0.979,$ and $0.995$ respectively. These results make sense since an increase in sample size implies an increase in power. The large number of replicates gives a greater confidence in power estimate.


## Results:
Thus, about $98.5\%$ percent of the time, the claim that holiday does not have an influennce over average number of bikes rented daily will be rightly rejected for a sample size of 731. From the supporting results, for a power estimate of about $80\%$ and above, sample size should be atleast 350.
