Simulation_SNPsANs.R contains the simulation for observing the uncertainty in reference allele numbers, 2N, using African/African American GnomAD data for 1000, 10000, and 100000 SNPs. Number of people, N, was fixed for the two ancestry groups (i.e., African and European) considering N = 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 50, 100, 500, and 1000. Plots were generated for ancestry proportion estimates, difference in simulated and observed allele frequencies, and least squares value for each N and SNP. Variability between simulated and observed allele frequencies were plotted against N and N^2 to observe if the variance is a function of N. 

Simulation_SNPsANs_Latinx.R contains the simulation for observing the uncertainty in reference allele numbers, 2N, using American/Latinx GnomAD data for 1000, 10000, and 100000 SNPs. Number of people, N, was fixed for the two ancestry groups (i.e., African and European) considering N = 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 50, 100, 500, and 1000. Plots were generated for ancestry proportion estimates, difference in simulated and observed allele frequencies, and least squares value for each N and SNP. Variability between simulated and observed allele frequencies were plotted against N and N^2 to observe if the variance is a function of N.

Simulation_SNPsVarANs.R contains the simulation for observing the uncertainty in reference allele numbers, 2N, using African/African American GnomAD data for 1000, 10000, and 100000 SNPs. Number of people, N, was varied for the two ancestry groups (i.e., African and European) considering N = 10, 20, 50, 100, and 500. All pairwise combinations of N were plotted.
