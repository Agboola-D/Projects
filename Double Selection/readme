Simulation study to compare neighborhood-based cross fittting (proposed method excluded from the code) mainly with repeated sample splitting (existing method) under different scenarios.
Causal inference is the goal using different machine learning techniques
Sample size (n) and variables (p) are varied with a treatment variable included - p >> n
Various covariance structures and sparsity assumptions are considered 

The image is a result of a simulation scenario comparing my proposed method with existing methods
